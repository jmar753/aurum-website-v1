                <p>Aurum Manufacturing is a Canadian based manufacturer specializing in the replacement solutions for outdated fan coil systems. We are dedicated to working closely with suppliers, vendors and contractors to deliver superior products for the end user. All Aurum model fan coil units are made with the highest degree of quality and craftsmanship. Aurum has focused their goal on creating solutions for energy efficiency and effective air control and movement.  Over the years, we have manufactured equipment for thousands of projects and applications including residential and commercial multi-story buildings. We stand by our designs and being a leader in the HVAC industry, we pride ourselves in being able to customize our models to meet and exceed our customer’s needs. Our various fan coil unit sizes have been manufactured to fit the dimensions of almost all buildings that have been built within the past 50+ years. Aurum’s flexibility and expertise allows us to provide designs that fit the building, rather than forcing the building to fit the equipment.</p>
