A recirculation port is arranged between a supply air chamber and an outside air chamber. A damper is adapted to move between a first position in which the damper blocks the recirculation port and a second position in which the recirculation port is unblocked. When the damper is in the second position, at least a portion of supply air is guided to flow from the supply air chamber through the outside air chamber to the heat exchanger core so as to defrost the heat exchanger core.",
